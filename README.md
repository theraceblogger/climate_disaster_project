Climate Disaster Project

This project entails gathering data from NOAA and EM-DAT (and maybe others) through api's, 
create and populate this database with that data, 
and perform analytics on it. I am running a Postgres database on Google Cloud Platform.


This will be automated with Airflow and have Git for version control.

Finally, the results will be shown on a dashboard (maybe Tableau) and include predictive analytics, 
time-lapse visualizations, 
and interactivity to choose certain regions around the world and date ranges.
